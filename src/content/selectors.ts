 * here names a class. The anchors are landmarks, roles, `data-pagelet`, and
 * `href` shapes. Several selectors also pin an exact nesting depth with
 * `:has(> div > ...)`, which is the brittle part: Instagram moving a wrapper
 * breaks them silently, and only the real-site lane notices.
 *
 * Which route a section applies on is `routes.ts`'s decision, not this
 * table's. A selector here may well match on other routes (profile pages have a
 * tablist too), which is fine only because the section attribute is never set
 * there.
